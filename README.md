# Project-Deep-Learning
The intention is to design, train and test a deep Neural Network implemented using Keras library on a data-set of images of many cells to predict presence of a malarial infection. 

The Front-End of the Web-App has been made using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4 and jQuery, while the Back-End of the Web-App has been made using Flask. 

-Note: The Dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle. Visit https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria to download all the images
